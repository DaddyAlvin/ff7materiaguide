    <h1>Summary of materia</h1>
    <p>Materia is the system used for magic in final fantasy 7, ItÂ´s used to boost the characthers certain stats and are a means to to deal damage or assist in other ways during battle.</p>
    <p>There are several different types of materia which use different kinds of attributes. The materias are put into five categories, Magic, Commando, Independent, Support and Summons.</p>
    <p>These materias are then used by putting them on weapons and armor to be able to use them, some require magic power and others are used constantly in battle without cost when equipped.</p>

    <p> As visually described in this image we have a weapon equipped with 2 slots where we can fit materia in, when the slot is glowing with a specific colour we can identify what type of materia is currently equipped. In the same way you are able to see when a slot is empty by the gray and black circular form it represents. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>  
    <p> We can also wittnes that in this image the materia equipped on the weapon boosts a certain stat, by equipping materia your characther will gain or lose some of their stats according to type of materia it is you are using . This could range from more hp and less mp to higher magic power and defence. </p>
